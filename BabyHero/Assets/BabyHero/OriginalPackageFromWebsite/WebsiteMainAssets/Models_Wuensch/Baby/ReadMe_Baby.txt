Cartoon baby character asset by Oliver Wuensch 2016
email: support@wuenschonline.de

fully Mechanim humanoid compatible, tested with ThirdPerson controller (Opsive), LipSync pro, Dynamic bone, Movement Animset pro motions
Asset only contains the model and textures, not the above mentioned assets I used for the WebGL Demo.

Instructions:
After installing the asset from assetstore go to Modles_Wuensch ->Baby->Prefabs and drag the desired prefab into your Scene.

Glasses and Pacifier are parented to Head and Jaw Joints, remove or seactivate if not wanted.

Then set up your mechanim animator and you are ready to go.

inside Texture_Layeres_Photoshop.zip you will find the layered color textures.
If you wish to customize the textures these will make it really easy as every element is on a separate layer.

Ther eis als a logo dummy layer in case you want to add a logo to the t-shirt of the character.

Have fun, baby:-)
