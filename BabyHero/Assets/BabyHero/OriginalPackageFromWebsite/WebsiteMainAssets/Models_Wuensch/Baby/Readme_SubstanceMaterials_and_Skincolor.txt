A short written overview:
******************
The new mesh BabyBoyGirl is the base, drag it to your scene or use one of the Prefabs found in the PrefabsBoyGirl Folder. Prefabs are already set up with materials.
******************
If using the basic mesh and not a prefab,drag it to scene, choose your desired hairstyle, deactivate or delete the ones not wanted (the hairmeshes are skinned to the hair and hair 1 joint--- if you want to make them wiggle as secondary animation the easiest way would be the highly recommended asset "Dynamic Bone" by Will Hong. Use dynamic bone on hair and hair 1 bone and all hairstyles extending parts will wiggle)
Make the character head and body more feminin (and get rid of the boys hair strand) by setting the blendshape on Baby_2 mesh Skinned Mesh renderer "GirlBaseModifier" to 100. Also note that there are 2 Blenshapes for the eyes shape, "Cateye" and "Dogeye" that you can use to change the appearance.

Folder Materials_Substance contains 
BabyColors.sbsar and BabyGirlHairstyles.sbsar.

Add a material generated by Babycolors.sbsar to the Baby_2 mesh's  Skinned Mesh renderer Material (Element 0).
Add the appropriate material from BabyGirlHairstyles.sbsar to the corresponding hair part.
Tune your materials in the procedural properties settings.
